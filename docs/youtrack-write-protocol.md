# hk → YouTrack write protocol (hk 3667, hk 3697, hk 3739, hk 3810)

Status: **b1, every comment on a verified task gets a protocol copy (mode on).** The protocol core (b0) is live for comments:
every new hk comment on a task that has a verified issue in YouTrack gets a
protocol-tracked copy on the task's YouTrack issue, when
`HANDOFFKEEP_YT_COMMENTS_MODE=on`. Canary mode (`HANDOFFKEEP_YT_COMMENTS_MODE=canary`)
keeps its meaning (enrolled tasks only). PG stays canonical for comments; the
`task_comments` row is written exactly as before. Default mode is `off` (no op
row, no YouTrack call). Design: `design/2026-11-09/hk3667-youtrack-write-path`
(v2 wins), `consult/2026-11-09/hk3667-write-path-answer`,
`decision/2026-11-09/r9-data-map-memory-inbox` §4.

YouTrack has no transactions, no conditional update and no idempotency key. hk
supplies them with a durable op log. The rules live in `internal/ytwrite`; the
Postgres log is `internal/store/yt_write_ops.go`; the fake YouTrack, the
in-memory log and the contract suites are `internal/ytwrite/ytwritetest`.

## Op row (`yt_write_ops`)

One row per logical write, committed **before** any remote call.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | op id; appears in the provenance line and the body marker |
| `principal`, `kind`, `idem_key` | unique together: the idempotency key is scoped per authenticated principal and op kind, never derived from body text |
| `payload_sha`, `payload` | what the write means (a hash, to tell a replay from key reuse) and the immutable outbound payload (JSON); the exact text sent is a pure function of the op and this payload |
| `entity_kind`, `entity_id`, `yt_target_id` | the hk entity whose writes are ordered (`task`, `3697`) and the YouTrack id written to |
| `tenant` | the YouTrack host the op was bound to when it was prepared (b1a; `''` for an op prepared without one). Part of the write's identity: it is in `payload_sha`, immutable by trigger, and only a dispatcher configured for that tenant sends or searches for the op |
| `actor`, `created_at` | who the write is attributed to, and when (rendered in the provenance line) |
| `parent_id`, `child_seq` | parent/child plan for multi-step writes; stored now, settled by the first multi-step slice (b3) |
| `state` | `prepared → dispatched → applied \| rejected \| remote_unknown` |
| `yt_result_id` | YouTrack id of the created thing (set on `applied`) |
| `reason`, `last_error`, `attempts`, `reconciles` | latest cause code and detail; dispatch count; evidence-search count |
| `next_attempt_at`, `dispatched_at`, `resolved_at` | scheduling and lifecycle times (Go clock, passed in) |

`yt_entity_map(entity_kind, hk_key, yt_id, yt_parent_id, op_id)` holds the PG map
rows an op commits **in the same transaction** as its `applied` (a comment appended
by op 17 maps `comment/op:17` to its YouTrack comment id). Both directions are
unique, so one YouTrack id can never name two hk identities.

A trigger makes the table append-only: identity and payload columns never change,
a resolved row never changes, only the lifecycle's moves are allowed, nothing is
deleted.

**Migration** `20261109-yt-write-ops` (expand-only): two new tables, three partial
indexes, one trigger function. It touches no existing table and takes no lock on
one (new, empty tables only); the previous release neither reads nor writes them.

## Lifecycle

```
Submit ─► prepared ─Claim─► dispatched ─┬─ 2xx + valid id ─────────► applied
              ▲                         ├─ 4xx (not 401/408/429) ──► rejected
              │                         ├─ 429 / 401 ──────────────► prepared (later next_attempt_at)
              └─────────────────────────┤   (the request was not processed)
                                        └─ 5xx, 408, transport error, ─► remote_unknown
                                           2xx without id, crash          │
                      applied ◄── exactly one exact-body match ───────────┤
                      rejected ◄─ operator: "it did not happen" ──────────┘
```

- **One attempt per dispatch.** The client never retries a create inside the call.
- **`prepared` is never sent; `dispatched` may have been.** Dispatch ownership is a
  compare-and-set committed before the remote call, so a crash in `prepared` is safe
  to resume and a crash in `dispatched` is uncertain. A `dispatched` op older than
  `StaleAfter` becomes `remote_unknown` (a crash between the claim and the send
  looks the same, so it stays unknown too: conservative, never a resend).
- **No automatic re-create.** `remote_unknown` is left only by positive evidence or
  by an operator. Evidence: enumerate **all** comments of the target (paged, no
  assumption about order) and find exactly one whose text equals the rendered body,
  marker included. Absence, several matches, a deleted match, a marker with other
  text, or a failed search all keep `remote_unknown` (each with its own reason
  code). Search is a candidate finder, never negative proof.
- **429 honours Retry-After** as the server sent it, seconds or HTTP date, to the
  second: `next_attempt_at` is the server's deadline and no request (the POST, or
  the evidence search after a listing 429) is made before it. The only cap is a
  sanity bound for absurd values, `ytwrite.RetryAfterCap` (30 days): a longer
  wait is recorded as 30 days, never dropped. 401 waits for a repaired token. Both
  put the op back to `prepared` (a listing 429 keeps it `remote_unknown`) with a
  later `next_attempt_at`, because the request was not processed.
- **Caller cancellation never cancels a write or its reconciliation**: everything
  after the claim runs on a context detached from the caller's. Each step is
  still bounded: the remote call by `DispatchTimeout`, and recording its outcome
  by `SettleTimeout`. A settlement that cannot finish in time (the server is
  stopping, the op row is locked) is abandoned: the op stays `dispatched`, durable
  and unrecorded, stale recovery makes it `remote_unknown`, and the marker search
  applies it. It is never marked `applied` without the ledger's own commit, and
  it is never sent again.

## Per-entity ordering

An op is claimed only when the ledger admits it (else `ClaimHeld`: it stays
`prepared`, nothing is sent) and every earlier op (smaller id) on the same
`(entity_kind, entity_id)` is `applied` or `rejected`. Admission is decided in the
claim's own transaction. `Due` leaves out what `Claim` would hold or block, so a
long held or blocked queue never fills a pass. The check and the insert of a
new op both take an advisory lane lock, so an op that commits after a later op's
check cannot be passed. A `remote_unknown` op therefore holds its entity's later
writes (they answer `pending / waiting_for_earlier_op`) until it resolves. Other
entities are not held.

## What a caller gets

Every path (HTTP, MCP, CLI) gets one `ytwrite.Result`:

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `OpID` | the handle; keep it, and `Lookup` it |
| `Status` | `pending`, `applied` or `rejected`; **pending is never success** |
| `State`, `Reason` | lifecycle state and a stable cause code (`rate_limited`, `remote_unknown`, `waiting_for_earlier_op`, `http_404`, …) |
| `RetryAfter` | when to look again |
| `YTID` | the YouTrack id, only when applied |
| `Replayed` | the key already named a recorded op |

`AppendComment` returns an error only before the op row is durable (invalid request,
`ErrKeyConflict`, ledger down). Pending is promised only after durability. The same
key and payload replays the recorded result; the same key with another payload is
`ErrKeyConflict` (HTTP 409 in b1a). An empty key generates one, which cannot
deduplicate: the caller must keep the `OpID`.

## Provenance (decision §3)

REST cannot set a comment's author or time, so every hk-written comment is

```
작성: <actor> · <UTC time> · hk op <id>

<body>

<!-- hk-op:<id> -->
```

(`ytwrite.ProvenanceLine`, `ParseProvenance`, `RenderComment`; time is RFC 3339 UTC
with seconds; the time is the op's `created_at`, so a resend or a reconciliation
renders the same bytes). A caller's body may not contain `<!-- hk-op:` and an actor
may not contain ` · `, so marker-shaped text is data, never evidence.

## Remote contract (`ytwrite.Remote`)

- `CreateComment` makes exactly one attempt. A nil error with an empty or
  invalid id is a 2xx the protocol cannot trust: `remote_unknown`.
- `ListComments` returns a **complete and consistent** set or an error. An
  offset-paging adapter must use `EnumerateStableComments`: two full reads per
  attempt, accepted only when both give the same set of `(id, text, updated,
  deleted)`, at most three attempts, then `ErrInconsistentEnumeration`. One read
  of more than `MaxEnumeratedComments` (10 000) comments is
  `ErrEnumerationTooLarge`. Any listing error keeps the op `remote_unknown`
  (`reconcile_failed`); a 429 listing is a `RemoteError` whose `RetryAfter`
  delays the next search at least that long.
- Recovery is per attempt: `RecoverStale(id, attempts, cutoff)` moves a
  `dispatched` op to `remote_unknown` only if that same dispatch attempt is
  still the stale one (compare-and-set on `attempts` and `dispatched_at`).

## YouTrack adapter (`internal/youtrack/write_remote.go`)

One request per call: no retry inside the call, redirects are not followed (a
POST is never replayed), `Retry-After` (seconds or HTTP date) is passed up as
sent (an HTTP date is read against the adapter's clock, `WriteRemote.Now`; only
waits past `ytwrite.RetryAfterCap` are cut to it), and the bot key is removed from
every error text, including a body read error, before it can reach the op log.
Listings request `id,text,created,updated,deleted`.

| Single POST observation | Adapter returns | Op |
|---|---|---|
| 2xx with a usable id | id | `applied` |
| 2xx without a usable id, unreadable body | `"", nil` | `remote_unknown` (`no_id_in_reply`) |
| timeout, connection loss, cancel, 3xx | transport error | `remote_unknown` |
| 408, 5xx | `RemoteError` | `remote_unknown` (`http_5xx`) |
| 401 | `RemoteError` | `prepared`, retried after the auth wait |
| 429 | `RemoteError` + wait | `prepared` until `Retry-After` (kept as sent, up to 30 days) |
| other 4xx (400, 403, 404, 409, 422, …) | `RemoteError` | `rejected` (`http_<status>`) |

## Slice b1: comments mode on

**Gate.** `HANDOFFKEEP_YT_COMMENTS_MODE` = unset or `off` (default), `canary` or `on`.
Any other value, and `canary` or `on` without `YOUTRACK_URL` and `YOUTRACK_BOT_API_KEY`,
stops `serve` at startup (fail closed). `off` needs no YouTrack configuration.
`canary` and `on` need the two keys but do not turn on serve's legacy read-through
(the priority/lane overlay, YouTrack search and the lane/priority outbox):
that has its own gate, `HANDOFFKEEP_YT_READTHROUGH_MODE` (default `off`,
`docs/youtrack.md`), and the worker reads the keys itself.

**Preflight and Backfill.**
`handoffkeep youtrack comments-preflight [--project P] [--days N]` audits tasks with
comments in the last N days without writes: per hk project, counts of tasks that
resolve+verify, have no issue, or are ambiguous, with up to 10 sample IDs each.
`handoffkeep youtrack comments-backfill [--project P] [--days N]` verifies and records
bindings into `yt_task_bindings` for tasks that resolve and verify.

**Enqueue.** Every comment entry point (REST and the CLI through it, console,
MCP `task_comment`) goes through `CreateTaskComment` / `CreateMCPTaskComment`.
When the gate is `on` and the task has a verified issue (in `yt_task_bindings`,
`yt_entity_map` or `yt_comment_canary`), or when the gate is `canary` and the task
is enrolled in `yt_comment_canary`, the same transaction writes the comment, its op
(principal `hk:task-comments`, key `task-comment:<comment id>`, lane `("task", "<id>")`,
target the bound internal issue id, actor the comment author, time the comment time),
its ownership row `yt_comment_write_links(comment_id, op_id)`, and its `yt_entity_map`
task row. The op is bound to the verified tenant (`yt_write_ops.tenant`). A task with
no verified issue gets **no op and no link**, so legacy push and import continue
carrying its comments. Text PG accepts but the protocol cannot send (a quoted `<!-- hk-op:`
marker, an actor with ` · `) and a task whose map row names another issue commit the
comment with a **locally rejected** op; nothing is sent. Handlers never call `AppendComment`.
The YouTrack activity pull and dots replies do not enqueue.
The YouTrack activity pull and dots replies do not enqueue.

**Projection metadata.** The REST create answer (`POST /v1/tasks/{id}/comments`,
201), the CLI's `comment` output (it prints that answer) and the MCP
`task_comment` envelope keep every key and type they had and add one object,
`youtrack_projection`:

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `status` | `none` (mode off or task not enrolled: no op), `pending` (an op will copy it), `rejected` (refused locally; nothing will be sent) or, only on an MCP replay of a comment already copied, `applied` |
| `op_id` | the op, when there is one; see it in the operator view |
| `reason` | only with `rejected`: the op's stable reason code (`invalid_comment`, `ambiguous_issue`), never its free-form error |

A fresh comment is never reported `applied`: the local commit is not a YouTrack
write. An MCP replay reports the original comment's op and creates none. The
console form answer is unchanged.

**Dispatch.** One worker in `serve` runs `Drive` every 5 s, sequentially, over
`Store.YTCommentLedger(tenant)`, the ledger scoped to the tenant `YOUTRACK_URL`
names:

- *Tenant binding.* It lists, claims and searches only ops bound to its own
  tenant. An op prepared while its task was enrolled on tenant A is never sent to
  or searched for on tenant B, even after the task is removed and enrolled again
  on B with the same internal issue id: re-enrollment never retargets an op. Such
  an op stays `prepared` (or `remote_unknown`), visible in the operator view with
  its `tenant`, until a worker on A handles it or the operator resolves it.
- *Admission in the claim.* `Claim` admits a prepared op only when the gate is
  on and the task is still enrolled with the op's issue on the op's tenant, read
  inside the claim's transaction under the task's lane lock. The canary's writers
  (`youtrack canary add|remove`) take the same lane lock, so a removal either
  commits first (the claim holds the op: `ClaimHeld`, reason `held`, it stays
  `prepared` and is never rejected for it) or waits for a claim that already
  committed. There is no separate check before the claim.
- *Fair passes.* `Due` leaves held prepared ops out before its limit (50), so
  any number of held lanes cannot crowd out an admitted lane; `remote_unknown`
  ops of the tenant are always listed, because their evidence search is
  read-only and must go on after a removal.
- *Bounded stop.* The worker uses a 3 s dispatch timeout and a 1 s settlement
  timeout, 4 s together, under serve's 5 s worker stop budget, so it returns
  before the store closes. A call in flight when serve stops finishes or times
  out (`remote_unknown`); a settlement that cannot finish in 1 s leaves the op
  `dispatched`, and the next worker's stale recovery and marker search apply it
  without a second POST. A stopping worker claims nothing new.

Two serve processes may both run the worker; the ledger's claim is the
boundary.

**No double copy.** The legacy mirror push (`youtrack sync`) skips comments
with an ownership row. The import export marks them (`hk_op_id` on
`/v1/import/comments` rows) and `youtrack/import/client.js` skips a comment by
that ownership only; a PG comment whose body merely quotes `<!-- hk-op:` is
imported like any other. The activity pull drops a YouTrack comment as hk's own
echo, whoever its author, only when both hold: its text is exactly in the
rendered form (provenance line naming op N, body, blank line, op N's marker as
the end: `ytwrite.RenderedOpID`), and op N is a comment op hk wrote to that same
issue (`Store.YTCommentEchoOp`). A comment that quotes a marker, names an op hk
does not have, or names an op written to another issue is pulled as an ordinary
comment.

**Operator view.** `GET /v1/yt/ops?state=&task=&after_id=&limit=` and
`handoffkeep youtrack ops [--state S] [--task N] [--after-id N] [--limit N]`
(`handoffkeep yt …` is the same command). `state` is `pending` (default:
prepared, dispatched, remote_unknown), `all`, or one state. Each op shows id,
kind, lane, target, tenant, actor, state, `status` (`pending` for every unresolved
state, `remote_unknown` included), reason code, result id, attempts and times;
never the body, the raw error or the key. A full page carries
`next_after_id`.

**Migration** `20261109-yt-comment-canary` (expand-only, after
`20261109-yt-write-ops`; unreleased, so the tenant column was added to it in
place): tables `yt_comment_canary` and `yt_comment_write_links`, the column
`yt_write_ops.tenant TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` and a trigger that keeps it
immutable. Locks, all on `yt_write_ops`, which no earlier release reads or
writes: ACCESS EXCLUSIVE briefly for `ADD COLUMN` (a constant default rewrites
no row), SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE for `CREATE TRIGGER` and for the link table's
foreign key. No lock on `tasks` or `task_comments` (no foreign key to either).
The previous release does not read or write any of these objects.

**Logs.** `ytwrite.comment_enqueued`, `ytwrite.op_state` (one per recorded
transition), `ytwrite.outcome_record_failed` (a settlement that did not finish),
`ytwrite.drive`, `ytwrite.drive_failed`, `ytwrite.comments_enabled`.

## Tests

`ytwritetest.RunProtocol` (public contract) and `RunLedger` (compare-and-set rules)
run against both the in-memory ledger (`go test ./internal/ytwrite/`, no database)
and the Postgres ledger (`internal/store`, `testdb`, CI). The fake YouTrack can:
commit then drop the reply, delay a commit beyond reconciliation, answer 2xx without
an id, 429 with Retry-After, 5xx (with or without the commit), 4xx, fail the comment
listing, page at a server cap. Covered: no false done, no duplicate create, same key
with another payload is a conflict, concurrent same-key callers send once, crash at
each ledger/remote boundary (before and after the commit of prepare, claim, apply,
mark-unknown, defer), two writes to one entity in order, evidence paging and exact
match, ambiguous evidence, caller cancellation.

## Not yet (later slices)

- Turning the mode on in production (handoffkeep-design with the operator,
  after deploy), and the authority epoch (design v2.3).
- The event-feed row an applied op commits, parent/child settling (b3),
  article generations (b2), claims with a fencing generation (v2.2).
- A direct GET of the created comment before answering `applied`; the live
  canary measures index latency, marker preservation and read-after-write.
