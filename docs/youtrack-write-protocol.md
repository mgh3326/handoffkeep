# hk → YouTrack write protocol (hk 3667, hk 3697)

Status: **b0, nothing switched.** The protocol core, the op log schema and the
fault tests exist; no hk code path calls them, no flag is on, and no production
YouTrack write happens. The first caller is slice b1a (one authenticated comment
append on a mapped task). Design: `design/2026-11-09/hk3667-youtrack-write-path`
(v2 wins), `consult/2026-11-09/hk3667-write-path-answer`,
`decision/2026-11-09/r9-data-map-memory-inbox`.

YouTrack has no transactions, no conditional update and no idempotency key. hk
supplies them with a durable op log. The rules live in `internal/ytwrite`; the
Postgres log is `internal/store/yt_write_ops.go`; the fake YouTrack, the
in-memory log and the contract suites are `internal/ytwrite/ytwritetest`.

## Op row (`yt_write_ops`)

One row per logical write, committed **before** any remote call.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | op id; appears in the provenance line and the body marker |
| `principal`, `kind`, `idem_key` | unique together: the idempotency key is scoped per authenticated principal and op kind, never derived from body text |
| `payload_sha`, `payload` | what the write means (a hash, to tell a replay from key reuse) and the immutable outbound payload (JSON); the exact text sent is a pure function of the op and this payload |
| `entity_kind`, `entity_id`, `yt_target_id` | the hk entity whose writes are ordered (`task`, `3697`) and the YouTrack id written to |
| `actor`, `created_at` | who the write is attributed to, and when (rendered in the provenance line) |
| `parent_id`, `child_seq` | parent/child plan for multi-step writes; stored now, settled by the first multi-step slice (b3) |
| `state` | `prepared → dispatched → applied \| rejected \| remote_unknown` |
| `yt_result_id` | YouTrack id of the created thing (set on `applied`) |
| `reason`, `last_error`, `attempts`, `reconciles` | latest cause code and detail; dispatch count; evidence-search count |
| `next_attempt_at`, `dispatched_at`, `resolved_at` | scheduling and lifecycle times (Go clock, passed in) |

`yt_entity_map(entity_kind, hk_key, yt_id, yt_parent_id, op_id)` holds the PG map
rows an op commits **in the same transaction** as its `applied` (a comment appended
by op 17 maps `comment/op:17` to its YouTrack comment id). Both directions are
unique, so one YouTrack id can never name two hk identities.

A trigger makes the table append-only: identity and payload columns never change,
a resolved row never changes, only the lifecycle's moves are allowed, nothing is
deleted.

**Migration** `20261109-yt-write-ops` (expand-only): two new tables, three partial
indexes, one trigger function. It touches no existing table and takes no lock on
one (new, empty tables only); the previous release neither reads nor writes them.

## Lifecycle

```
Submit ─► prepared ─Claim─► dispatched ─┬─ 2xx + valid id ─────────► applied
              ▲                         ├─ 4xx (not 401/408/429) ──► rejected
              │                         ├─ 429 / 401 ──────────────► prepared (later next_attempt_at)
              └─────────────────────────┤   (the request was not processed)
                                        └─ 5xx, 408, transport error, ─► remote_unknown
                                           2xx without id, crash          │
                      applied ◄── exactly one exact-body match ───────────┤
                      rejected ◄─ operator: "it did not happen" ──────────┘
```

- **One attempt per dispatch.** The client never retries a create inside the call.
- **`prepared` is never sent; `dispatched` may have been.** Dispatch ownership is a
  compare-and-set committed before the remote call, so a crash in `prepared` is safe
  to resume and a crash in `dispatched` is uncertain. A `dispatched` op older than
  `StaleAfter` becomes `remote_unknown` (a crash between the claim and the send
  looks the same, so it stays unknown too: conservative, never a resend).
- **No automatic re-create.** `remote_unknown` is left only by positive evidence or
  by an operator. Evidence: enumerate **all** comments of the target (paged, no
  assumption about order) and find exactly one whose text equals the rendered body,
  marker included. Absence, several matches, a deleted match, a marker with other
  text, or a failed search all keep `remote_unknown` (each with its own reason
  code). Search is a candidate finder, never negative proof.
- **429 honours Retry-After** (clamped to one hour; the old 5 s cap is not used) and
  401 waits for a repaired token; both put the op back to `prepared` with a later
  `next_attempt_at`, because the request was not processed.
- **Caller cancellation never cancels a write or its reconciliation**: everything
  after the claim runs on a context detached from the caller's.

## Per-entity ordering

An op is claimed only when every earlier op (smaller id) on the same
`(entity_kind, entity_id)` is `applied` or `rejected`. The check and the insert of a
new op both take an advisory lane lock, so an op that commits after a later op's
check cannot be passed. A `remote_unknown` op therefore holds its entity's later
writes (they answer `pending / waiting_for_earlier_op`) until it resolves. Other
entities are not held.

## What a caller gets

Every path (HTTP, MCP, CLI) gets one `ytwrite.Result`:

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `OpID` | the handle; keep it, and `Lookup` it |
| `Status` | `pending`, `applied` or `rejected`; **pending is never success** |
| `State`, `Reason` | lifecycle state and a stable cause code (`rate_limited`, `remote_unknown`, `waiting_for_earlier_op`, `http_404`, …) |
| `RetryAfter` | when to look again |
| `YTID` | the YouTrack id, only when applied |
| `Replayed` | the key already named a recorded op |

`AppendComment` returns an error only before the op row is durable (invalid request,
`ErrKeyConflict`, ledger down). Pending is promised only after durability. The same
key and payload replays the recorded result; the same key with another payload is
`ErrKeyConflict` (HTTP 409 in b1a). An empty key generates one, which cannot
deduplicate: the caller must keep the `OpID`.

## Provenance (decision §3)

REST cannot set a comment's author or time, so every hk-written comment is

```
작성: <actor> · <UTC time> · hk op <id>

<body>

<!-- hk-op:<id> -->
```

(`ytwrite.ProvenanceLine`, `ParseProvenance`, `RenderComment`; time is RFC 3339 UTC
with seconds; the time is the op's `created_at`, so a resend or a reconciliation
renders the same bytes). A caller's body may not contain `<!-- hk-op:` and an actor
may not contain ` · `, so marker-shaped text is data, never evidence.

## Tests

`ytwritetest.RunProtocol` (public contract) and `RunLedger` (compare-and-set rules)
run against both the in-memory ledger (`go test ./internal/ytwrite/`, no database)
and the Postgres ledger (`internal/store`, `testdb`, CI). The fake YouTrack can:
commit then drop the reply, delay a commit beyond reconciliation, answer 2xx without
an id, 429 with Retry-After, 5xx (with or without the commit), 4xx, fail the comment
listing, page at a server cap. Covered: no false done, no duplicate create, same key
with another payload is a conflict, concurrent same-key callers send once, crash at
each ledger/remote boundary (before and after the commit of prepare, claim, apply,
mark-unknown, defer), two writes to one entity in order, evidence paging and exact
match, ambiguous evidence, caller cancellation.

## Not in b0 (carried to later slices)

- Any caller: HTTP/MCP/CLI wiring, the idempotency header, the issue-id resolution
  from `task_origins`, the worker loop (`Drive`) in `serve`, flags and the authority
  epoch (design v2.3).
- The event-feed row an applied op commits (b1a), parent/child settling (b3),
  article generations (b2), claims with a fencing generation (v2.2).
- A direct GET of the created comment before answering `applied`, and the live
  canary against the real tenant (index latency, marker preservation, read-after-write
  are unknown until then).
